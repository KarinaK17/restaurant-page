# restaurant-page

My Restaurant Page project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path)

My first project using webpack. This is a restaurant site that uses tabbed browsing to access the Home, Contact and Menu pages. This page is build using JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Events. Every tab's content is put in its own module and then exported into the index.js to compile the site structure.
